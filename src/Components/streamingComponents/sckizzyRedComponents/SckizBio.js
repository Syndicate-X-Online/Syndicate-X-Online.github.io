/*Hey there, I'm Sckizzy. Welcome to my channel..I'm a variety streamer who enjoys getting to know my
 community. So feel free to say hi, and let us know how your day is going. I tend to play RPG, hack & 
 slash, looter shooter style games, grinding and leveling up. Not really a fan of FPS games, but I'm 
 not opposed to trying out new games I haven't played before and I'm always up for teaming up with 
 viewers if the games allow me to do so. I hope you enjoy your time here with us and I look forward to
  getting to know you.*/
